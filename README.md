# My Gleam Project

A command-line data processing pipeline that reads input from a file, validates and transforms the data (e.g., parsing numbers and computing averages), and handles errors gracefully using monadic concepts.

## Setup

Ensure you have Gleam installed. If not, run:

```bash
curl -L https://gleam.run/install | bash
```

## Running

```bash
gleam run
```

## Testing

```bash
gleam test
```
